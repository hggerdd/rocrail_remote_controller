# Connection Recovery Implementation Summary

## Problem
When WiFi connection is lost or Rocrail server disconnects, the controller gets "Send error: [Errno 128] ENOTCONN" and doesn't automatically recover.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Detection (`lib/async_controllers/async_protocol.py`)
- Added specific handling for ENOTCONN errors in `_send_task()` and `_receive_task()`
- Detects connection loss immediately when socket operations fail
- Properly closes broken connections before attempting reconnection

### 2. Automatic Reconnection System
- New `_auto_reconnect()` method with exponential backoff strategy
- Retry delays: 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, then 30s repeatedly
- Prevents duplicate reconnection attempts using task tracking
- Re-queries locomotive list after successful reconnection

### 3. Improved LED Feedback (`lib/async_controllers/async_leds.py`)
**Rocrail Status LED (LED 1):**
- **Bright Green (solid)**: Connected and working
- **Yellow (blinking)**: Initial connection attempt
- **Orange (fast blink)**: Actively reconnecting
- **Red (fast blink)**: Connection lost, waiting to reconnect
- **Red (solid)**: Error state
- **Dim Red**: Permanent failure

**WiFi Status LED (LED 0):**
- **Green (pulse)**: Connected
- **Orange (blink)**: Connecting
- **Red (blink)**: Failed

### 4. Connection Monitoring Updates
- Protocol monitor task checks less frequently (10s) as auto-reconnect handles most cases
- Prevents interference between monitor task and auto-reconnect mechanism
- Only triggers reconnection if not already in progress

## Key Features
1. **Immediate Error Detection**: Socket errors trigger instant reconnection
2. **Smart Backoff**: Prevents server flooding with exponential retry delays
3. **Clear Visual Feedback**: LEDs show exact connection state
4. **Robust Recovery**: Handles both WiFi drops and Rocrail server issues
5. **No Manual Intervention**: Fully automatic recovery process

## Testing
After deploying to ESP32:
1. Disconnect WiFi router - should see red blink then auto-recover
2. Stop Rocrail server - should see orange fast blink then reconnect
3. Network cable disconnect - should handle and recover
4. All scenarios should show appropriate LED feedback
