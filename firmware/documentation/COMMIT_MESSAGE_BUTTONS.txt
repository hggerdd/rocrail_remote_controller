fix: Button functionality in AsyncIO hardware controller

Fixed non-working buttons in asyncio implementation:

1. **Simplified button debouncing logic**:
   - Removed complex state tracking with multiple negations
   - Clear button press detection: transition from 1→0 (pull-up logic)
   - Proper state initialization with actual pin values

2. **Reduced debounce time**:
   - 50ms → 20ms for more responsive button feel
   - Maintains debouncing while improving responsiveness

3. **Added debug output**:
   - Button press detection now logged for debugging
   - Clear indication when buttons are recognized

4. **Fixed state tracking**:
   - _last_button_states stores actual pin values (0/1)
   - _last_button_times tracks timing for debouncing
   - Proper state updates on value changes

5. **Test utilities**:
   - test_raw_buttons.py - Raw pin value monitoring
   - test_minimal_buttons.py - AsyncHardwareManager testing
   - test_buttons_asyncio.py - Complete button functionality test

Technical fix: The original debouncing logic had multiple negations and complex state 
tracking that prevented proper button press detection. New logic directly compares 
pin values and detects the 1→0 transition that indicates a button press with pull-up resistors.

Usage: Run test_minimal_buttons.py to verify button functionality before using full controller.
