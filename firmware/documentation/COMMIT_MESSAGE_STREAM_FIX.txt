fix: MicroPython asyncio StreamWriter compatibility issues

- Fix 'Stream' object has no attribute 'is_closing' error
- Replace writer.is_closing() with hasattr(writer, 'write') checks
- Add compatibility wrapper for writer.wait_closed() method
- Add fallback for asyncio.wait_for() if not available in MicroPython
- Use try/except for optional stream methods to prevent crashes
- All stream operations now compatible with MicroPython asyncio implementation

Technical fixes:
* is_connected(): writer.is_closing() â†’ hasattr(writer, 'write')
* disconnect(): wait_closed() wrapped in hasattr() check
* connect(): wait_for() with fallback for MicroPython
* get_connection_info(): updated connection check logic
* All stream methods now gracefully handle MicroPython limitations

This resolves the "Protocol monitor error" during controller startup.
