fix: Implement robust auto-reconnection for WiFi/Rocrail connection loss

- Add automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (1sâ†’30s)
- Handle ENOTCONN socket errors properly in send/receive tasks
- Enhance LED feedback: orange=reconnecting, red=lost, green=connected
- Prevent duplicate reconnection attempts with task tracking
- Re-query locomotives after successful reconnection
- Update protocol monitor to work with auto-reconnect system

Fixes connection recovery issue when WiFi drops or Rocrail disconnects
